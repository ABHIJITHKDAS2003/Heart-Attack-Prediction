# Heart Attack Prediction


Predicting heart attacks with machine learning—because your health shouldn't be a guessing game.
📌 Overview
Heart attacks account for a staggering 27.2% of global deaths, and nearly 80% of heart attacks are estimated to be silent. To combat this, we developed a website that leverages machine learning to predict heart attack risks with precision.
This project integrates a trained ML model capable of assessing the probability of a heart attack based on user inputs such as age, sex, ECG readings, cholesterol levels, and more. The goal is to provide a simple yet accurate prediction model that empowers individuals to take proactive health measures.
🔍 How It Works
- Users enter their health data (e.g., Age, Chest Pain, BPS, Cholesterol Levels, ECG, etc.).
- The system runs the information through multiple ML algorithms using Google Colab.
- A selection of eight different models is tested, and the most accurate one is determined using ROC curves.
- Extreme Gradient Boost emerges as the best performer, achieving an accuracy of 90.16%.
- The final prediction is displayed, helping individuals assess their heart attack risk.
